What is Chatbot?
A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built; Retrieval based and Generative based models.
About the Python Project – Chatbot
In this Python project with source code, we are going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the user’s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.

Let’s create a retrieval based chatbot using NLTK, Keras, Python, etc.

The Dataset
The dataset we will be using is ‘intents.json’. This is a JSON file that contains the patterns we need to find and the responses we want to return to the user.
