About the Python Project
In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

The Dataset
Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. So in how many ways we can define a color? The answer is 256*256*256 = 16,581,375. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. In our dataset, we need to map each color’s values with their corresponding names. But don’t worry, we don’t need to map all the values. We will be using a dataset that contains RGB values with their corresponding names. The CSV file for our dataset has been taken from this link:
Steps for Building a Project in Python – Color Detection
 1.Taking an image from the user
 2.Next, we read the CSV file with pandas
 3. Set a mouse callback event on a window
 4. Create the draw_function
 5. Calculate distance to get color name
 6. Display image on the window
 7.Run Python File
