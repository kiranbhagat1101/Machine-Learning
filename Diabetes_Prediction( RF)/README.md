Diabetes Predictor End to End Web Deployment - Machine Learning


Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier
To build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?


About the Dataset
The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
Columns
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)Â²) DiabetesPedigreeFunction: It provided some data on diabetes mellitus history in relatives and the genetic relationship of those relatives to the patient.
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 is 1, the others are 0
